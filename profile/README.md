# ðŸ§¬ Web3 Set Theory

The Web3 Set Theory schema defines a simple, but extensible interface for applying information set theory to Web3 entities.

The primary objective is to contextualize relationships between different Entity types in varying EVM compute environments using a simple off-chain set based schema to organize the who, what, when, where, how... and why.

## Introduction

A Set is a collection of entities, conditions and rules. The entities must share similar properties and behaviors. The conditions define what "context" should be applied to entities. And finally rules relationships between entities contained within the set.

**All set schemas share the following core properties:**

- Entities
- Conditions
- Rules

The inherit simplicity, but also ability to define complex systems makes informal set theory a great candidate for mapping the emergent Ethereum metaverse.

Each Set type includes an entities, conditions and rules field, but each type has a unique Interfaces for the child items, which creates schema predictability across set types, but also flexibility as the system grows.
