# Web3 Set Theory

The Web3 Set Theory schema defines a simple, but extensible interface for applying information set theory to Web3 entities.

The primary objective is to contextualize relationships between different Entity types in varying EVM compute environments using a simple off-chain set based schema to organize the who, what, when, where, how... and why.

In other words, the composable and modular characteristics of protocols can continue to flourish and evolve across EVM environments (Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, etc...) but the proper metadata and user journey experience can be carefully crafted to contain the "chaos" and disorderliness inherit in decentralized systems - both from a technical and human perspective.

## 📖  Set Theory Schema (JSON Schema Draft 07 Specification)
http://json-schema.org/

The Informal Web3 Set Theory schema is the first attempt at defining, a simple framework for defining complex relationships.

In addition to grouping Entity types into sets, the Set schema also contains Rules and Conditions which are applied to the Entities for additional contextualization about expected final compute state.

In this way it differs slightly from the core principles of "set theory".

Instead of a simple taxonomy system to group sets of "things" or Entities together with like characteristics and properties. The set also applies restraints to how the Entity can be interacted with and how.

For example, a smart contract might have 20 method calls, but for a specific set that defines an end goal, we need a conditional for telling a user to call just 1 function on the smart contract.
