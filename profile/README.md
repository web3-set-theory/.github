# Web3 Set Theory

The Web3 Set Theory schema defines a simple, but extensible interface for applying information set theory to Web3 entities.

The primary objective is to contextualize relationships between different Entity types in varying EVM compute environments using a simple off-chain set based schema to organize the who, what, when, where, how... and why.
